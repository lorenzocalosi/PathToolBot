# PathToolBot

A simple PHP Telegram Bot for Pathfinder players/DMs - https://pathtoolbot.herokuapp.com/

## What is this

It's a very basic Pathfinder tool i made for my final exam in school... After i was done with it i kinda left it as it is, and never followed up on it, but it's on GitHub now, so you can all use and manipulate the code!

## Where can i find it

The bot is currently running on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), you can visit the public page here: https://pathtoolbot.herokuapp.com/
Here's the link to the actual Telegram Bot: https://pathtoolbot.herokuapp.com/

## What does it do

I gave the bot some basic functions: Monster, Trait, Spell and Skill searching and die rolling. It's supposed to make the DM's life easier by having a quickly accessible resource for all his DM needs.
Players can use it too of course, even for simple die rolling, or looking up that spell you always forget.

## What does it use

It uses Composer for dependencies and MongoDB for database stuff.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Alessandro Aglietti for helping me through this project, and guiding me through the basics of Bot Making and PHP programming.
